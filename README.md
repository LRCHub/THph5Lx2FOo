[00:31.78] Honestly, what would become of me
[00:35.69] Don't like reality
[00:38.25] It's way too clear to me
[00:41.25] But really, life is dandy
[00:45.19] We are what we don't see
[00:47.44] We miss everything daydreaming
[01:02.44] 
[00:52.21] Flames to dust, lovers to friends
[00:56.70] Why do all good things come to an end
[01:01.76] Flames to dust, lovers to friends
[01:06.32] Why do all good things come to an end
[01:11.23] Come to an end, come to an
[01:16.15] Why do all good things come to an end
[01:20.69] Come to an end, come to an
[01:26.15] Why do all good things come to an end
[01:44.65] 
[01:29.59] Travelling, I only stop at exits
[01:32.24] Wondering if I'll stay
[01:34.55] Young and restless
[01:37.10] Living this way, I stress less
[01:38.59] I want to pull away when the dream dies
[01:41.96] The pain sets in and I don't cry
[01:44.45] I only feel gravity and I wonder why
[02:02.45] 
[01:49.22] Flames to dust, lovers to friends
[01:54.23] Why do all good things come to an end
[01:58.76] Flames to dust, lovers to friends
[02:03.95] Why do all good things come to an end
[02:08.15] Come to an end, come to an
[02:13.51] Why do all good things come to an end
[02:17.76] Come to an end, come to an
[02:23.01] Why do all good things come to an end
[02:41.51] 
[02:26.60] Well the dogs were whistling a new tune
[02:29.67] Barking at the new moon
[02:31.78] Hoping it would come soon so that they could
[02:35.57] Dogs were whistling a new tune
[02:39.12] Barking at the new moon
[02:41.43] Hoping it would come soon so that they could
[02:45.17] Die, die, die, die
[02:54.17] 
[03:05.27] Flames to dust, lovers to friends
[03:10.45] Why do all good things come to an end
[03:14.96] Flames to dust, lovers to friends
[03:19.81] Why do all good things come to an end
[03:24.37] Come to an end, come to an
[03:29.69] Why do all good things come to an end
[03:33.97] Come to an end, come to an
[03:39.25] Why do all good things come to an end
[03:57.75] 
[03:42.33] Well the dogs were barking at the new moon
[03:45.64] Whistling a new tune
[03:48.01] Hoping it would come soon
[03:50.49] And the sun was wondering if it should
[03:55.24] Stay away for a day 'til the feeling went away
[03:59.99] And the sky was falling
[04:03.14] And the clouds were dropping and the rain
[04:06.59] Forgot how to bring salvation
[04:10.62] The dogs were barking at the new moon
[04:14.27] Whistling a new tune
[04:16.65] Hoping it would come soon so that they could die
