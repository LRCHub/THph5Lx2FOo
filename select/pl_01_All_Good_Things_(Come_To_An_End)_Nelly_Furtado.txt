Honestly what would become of me
Don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But really life is dandy
We are what we don't see
Miss everything daydreaming
Flames to dust dust
Lovers to friends friends
Why do all good things
come to an end end
Flames to dust dust
Lovers to friends friends
Why do all good things
come to an end end
Travelling I
only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away
when the dream dies
The pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feel gravity
and I wonder why
Flames to dust dust
Lovers to friends friends
Why do all good things
come to an end end
Flames to dust dust
Lovers to friends friends
Why do all good things
come to an end end
come to an end end come to an
Why do all good things
come to an end end
And he dogs were
whistling a new tune
barking at the new moon
hoping it will come soon
so that they could dogs were
whistling a new tune
barking at the new moon
hoping it will come soon
so that they could die
Die die die die
Flames to dust dust
Lovers to friends friends
