All good things come to an end
All good things come to an end

Every road you choose to follow
Starts out wide and ends up narrow
No matter how you play the game
It always ends up just the same

All good things come to an end
All good things come to an end

Every year there is a summer
But it always turns to winter
And there is nothing you can do
You must agree that this is true

And so (And so) that brings me on to something that is happenin' now
That love that lost its flames is always smould'ring now
And that's as much as it can do
That love belonged to me and you

All good things come to an end
All good things come to an end

What I'm really trying to tell you
Is it's better that I leave you
The love we had is nearly gone
So let's not drag it on and on

All good things come to an end, yeah
All good things come to an end, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
All good things come to an end
